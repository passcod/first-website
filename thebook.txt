			<h1>Writing Diary</h1>

<h2>10.22.7</h2>

<p>Yesterday I wrote the first chapter, and introduced 5 of the main 6 characters,
that is: <em>Lucyn</em>, <em>Pinim</em>, <em>Ale</em>, <em>Luma</em>, and there is one missing of the
original band of five, that the reader will meet later. There is also <em>Shvn</em>,
who is in the middle of some sort of initiation ritual, and that should keep
her occupied for most of half of the book, or until I decide she should come
out, at least.</p>

<p>I still need to do plenty of work on that chapter, it is very short at the
moment, and just kept at the bare minimum. This is the hard part for me, as I
do not like to overwrite, but at the same time, keeping a perfect style all 
the way through the book is not possible.</p>

<p>Today I found a website called <a href="http://www.fictionaut.com">fictionaut</a>, which is a very good idea: give
authors around the web the possibility to write and share short fiction, 
stories. The website says it is still in the invite-only sign up stage, so I
don't know whether to request one or what... a glance through the member list
showed all members are <strong>"old"</strong>, over 30 or so... maybe they do not want kids
messing around.</p>

<p>Lastly, I think I'm pretty decided on keeping <em>The Book I Dreamt Of</em> as the
final title.</p>

<p>Today was a good day, and I hope there will be more like it!</p>

<h2>10.22.6</h2>

<p>Rewrote the prologue. It changes the focus considerably, but the last week I 
spent imagining the book, reshaping it and making the story more complex, 
more alive.</p>

<p>You know, L&eacute;a, I finally chose: it will be 3b+2g. A simple choice
because the central character is a he... the blind boy of the prologue.</p>

<p>There's still not much to be read, but that will come soon. I am more ready 
than ever to write, and the only lacking item is time.</p>

<p>I think I'm gonna begin Chapter 1 now... </p>

<h2>10.20.3</h2>

<p>Three weeks have passed since I last wrote here. But I have not
been inactive in this regard for the last 21 days. I have been
imagining.</p>

<p>I had the basic idea when I started. But now I've got to immerge myself in this
universe I have been creating. Why? Well, it's very simple: my characters will
see, think, speak and act in the way they've always done... all their life, 
even if they do not exist yet!</p>

<p>I'll also rewrite the prologue. I actually wrote the first one to give me a
starting point, because I felt that if I didn't write anything, I'd give up the
idea entirely, without even having begun.</p>

<p>Anyways, I know <em>nobody</em> reads what I write right now, I'm writing it for those
who, later on, will read this diary.</p>

<p>And also for me.</p>

<h2>10.16.7</h2>

<p>I've written the prologue earlier in the afternoon. It's basically a diary
entry, 4 years into the future. The irony is it doesn't say anything except
that something <em>will</em> happen in 49&#46; In fact, it precises the date of the
first day (the first chapter) to be 49.47.9&#46;</p>

<p>I've thought about the title (if I'm not keeping "The Book I Dreamt Of", of
course). Nothing geniously great has popped up, but there is that one: "A 
Tahlr Tale". The first two words are a pun, except you won't look for it in
the right language: the words are English, but the pun is French. It's not a
pun to properly speak, English teachers will call it a <em>Mondegreen</em>. Those
first two words can be made into "&Agrave; t'&agrave; l'heure", which is short
for "&Agrave; tout &agrave; l'heure", which is french for "See you later". Not
great, but still.</p>

<p>For this to work, I have to precise the pronounciation of Tahlr. It's TAH-LER.
The <em>a</em> as in sp<em>a</em>, and the <em>er</em> as in pott<em>er</em>, mann<em>er</em>s, read<em>er</em>. I hope
you understand.</p>

<p>The (real) title will be determined much later, of course...</p>

<p>One last thing: I need to think about the names of the four main characters --
2b + 2g, and the last one we'll see when he/she appears.</p>

<p>P.S: Oh, and remind me to look up old and made up languages to create the
origins of the word (and the country) Tahlr.</p>

			<h1>The Book I Dreamt Of</h1>

<h2>Pronunciation</h2>

<h4>Of names and other words native to Talhr</h4>

<p>Each letter has its sound, like Spanish or French. Or latin.</p>

<p>The usual pronunciation rules apply, except:</p>

<ul>
<li>'y' is pronounced 'ya', or 'yah', with the French 'a', but short and almost
non-spoken.</li>
<li>'u' is the french 'u' or latin 'y'.</li>
<li>'e' is the latin 'e', or the french '&eacute;', and can be approached by the
english 'ay', as in 'May', or 'eh'. "Ale" is <em>not</em> pronounced like the
beverage, but a bit like 'Ah-l-eh'.</li>
<li>'v', in Shvn's language, is pronounced 'uh'. In other languages, it is the
normal 'v'. "Shvn" is thus pronounced a bit like the English name Sean, and
like the verb 'to shun'.</li>
<li>'hr' is 'er', as in 'butter'. The 'h' is not pronounced.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Characters</h2>

<p>Our five heroes are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Lucyn</em></li>
<li><em>Pinim</em></li>
<li><em>Ale</em></li>
<li><em>Luma</em></li>
<li><em>???</em></li>
</ul>

<p>and there is the mysterious <em>Shvn</em>.</p>

<h2>Language</h2>

<p>It will be written in English at the base, but I may write a French translation
as I go.</p>

			<h1>Blanck</h1>

<p>I'm going blind.</p>

<p>I might even never see again: right now, all I can see is blanck, all that dark
bright black blank landscape. It's happened before, but never this long... or 
has it? It's difficult to estimate time in blanck: with only my thoughts 
around, I could have been like that for ten seconds, ten minutes... ten hours.</p>

<p>You probably wonder how I came to be like that. It's a long story, but if you 
don't mind staying around for a little while, I will show you.</p>

<p>For now, if you could help me, I would be so ever grateful. Move a bit around,
make yourself comfortable. This could take a little while.</p>

<p>Now</p>

<p>look</p>

<p>down</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>And turn the page.</p>

			<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<h2>28.47.3</h2>

<h3>Pinim</h3>

<p>I am worried about Lucyn. As ever, he smiles, plays, and jokes - and oh do we
laugh! - but sometimes I see his eyes blur, and his smile strain, and even if
he laughs away any of my inquiries, saying 'Eh, Pinim, I think <em>your</em> eyes 
are funny!' I think he hides something, a pain, a wound, something happening 
to his eyes. But what?</p>

<p>I fear I might not discover that until it's too late. But Lucyn shouldn't hide
anything from us, we're his friends, after all! I'll talk to the others, maybe
they know something.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<h3>Lucyn</h3>

<p>That set me off. I did not think that it was that obvious, and maybe it is more
serious than I care to think. It's been months that I read Pinim's diary, to
see what she thinks of Ale... we all know Ale likes her, more than he cares to
say, except Pinim, who, strangely, seems not to notice. And her diary is no
more eloquent. But still, I hope that one day she'll see through her glasses, 
and discover Ale's eyes are shining.</p>

<p>However, today I realised she was busier looking at my eyes. Blurring? That's
something new. Or maybe it was there since the beginning, only I didn't realise
 - after all, it never happens in front of a mirror.</p>

<p>If it is that serious that people are starting to see it out in the open, then
it means there is something wrong. I need to talk about it... but how am I 
going to explain why I didn't share it earlier?</p>

<p>Tonight is Luma's birthday, tomorrow is another day, the day after will be too
late... I need time I haven't; but I'll sleep on it and see tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hopefully.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<h3>Shvn</h3>

<p>I must have been sleeping for too long, because I was hungry when I stood up.
But as much as I'd like to eat, Zvm made sure I didn't get any before I'd done
the daily ritual. It is the 93rd day into my Vweke, and the end is still very
far away - given that I can pass the challenges ahead, for which I am not ready
at all!</p>

<p>I need to eat now, and to sleep again.</p>
